NEW: Mike Pence &amp; his wife voted by mail in April, using a years-old address.

So despite their fear-mongering about mail-in voting, the following people have all voted by mail:
-VP Pence
-Press Sec. Kayleigh McEnany
-RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel Romney
-Trump
https://t.co/e7CRXWiv14
Daily reminder that Donald Trump voted by mail just last month.
‚ÄúTrump rally gives Fox News largest Saturday night audience in its history‚Äù https://t.co/XZaStbbRIp
So Trump, Ivanka, Jared, Kayleigh, Kellyanne, Pence, and Ronna McDaniel all voted by mail
By Trump's own account basically everyone he hires is someone who was on the skids personally and professionally but who begged Trump for one more chance to restore their reputation. Everyone told Trump they were three time losers but Trump gave them the job.
The struggle for women's equality was fought by brave &amp; inspiring women.

BLM do not care about Black Lives.  They are Marxists.   They only care about removing Trump from office so they can turn our Country into a 3rd world $hithole.
Abso fuckin lutely
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
6,200 people at Trump rally in Tulsa. Acts that had bigger crowds at the same venue in 2019:

- Sha Na Na
- The Pips (w/o Gladys Knight)
- Loverboy
- John Tesh 
- The West Virginia Touring Company of La Traviata
To all of you @realDonaldTrump enablers at @WhiteHouse and @GOP who said Trump was ‚Äújoking‚Äù about slowing down testing, he made you look like liars and fools again. He‚Äôs not joking. He‚Äôs pathetic, stupid and dangerous.

... so his answer is to remain blissfully ignorant of that actual real life spread of a virus during a pandemic... Give less tests so we have a lower number... are you fucking kidding me? Is this real life?
@realDonaldTrump THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED

https://t.co/lyYRerHfoX
In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.

Trump thinks mail in voting is rigging the election. That's why he votes by mail.
@NoraGon93416294 @thehill I am actually more concerned with Trump‚Äôs negligence than China‚Äôs.  He was the one going around praising Xi‚Äôs response and handling of the virus while saying it was fake news, a hoax to make him look bad and it‚Äôs only 15 people and soon it will be zero.
On a day when the president is again warning that voting by mail is sinister and will surely bring the republic down, there's word that VP &amp; Mrs. Pence voted by mail in April's Indiana primary. Adding to a long list of Repubs who like to mail it in, including Trump himself

We thought the COVID-19 scandal was Trump learning of the virus in January and doing nothing effective or relevant to curtail it until March. Wait until America learns the White House had all the details on the virus in November and failed to prevent the *December* outbreak here.
Some States/Cities require a mask, but you can take it off while eating, as long as you are 6ft apart while doing so...this is one hell of a smart virus; it knows not to infect while eating and knows not to travel past 6ft...you can't make this sh*t up!
We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.
The Trump Admin plays by a different set of rules. They are allowed to commit fraud.
If this was just a "joke," as we've been told, you'd think he'd have said so instead of continuing to dance around it.

It. Was. Not. A. Joke.

So Bill Barr is on Fox now claiming that mail-in voting will bring fraud. Good grief. What a hack Barr has turned out to be. He just keeps going lower and lower for Trump.
At the end of the day, Bolton's main criticism of @realDonaldTrump can be boiled down to:

"He didn't listen to my advice &amp; refused to carpet bomb half the world to start World War 3."

If Trump had taken Bolton's war mongering advice, do you really think he would be doing this?

Trump remains his enemies' greatest booster - Bolton's viewership for his ABC special last night w Raddatz was roughly 6 million, or, put another way, about double what Trump got for a special with ABC last year.
John Bolton received a reported $2 million advance for his book about his time in the Trump administration.

But a judge has raised the possibility that Bolton may not be able to keep it because he published without government approval.

It is very, very, very alarming Trump doesn't understand the tests are not causing the disease, they are just tracking the disease that already exists. This is very, very, very simple reasoning.

Catching up to @PressSec briefing. She keeps blaming the media for faulting Trump for phrases she says the "media" used. When did "media" say "Kung Flu?"
Trump supporters don't attack people and cities with molotov cocktails, break windows, burn police cars and or stab people. That's what the Left does.
NEW TV RATINGS RECORD: President Trump‚Äôs rally gave Fox News its largest Saturday night audience in its history: a whopping 7.7 million total viewers tuned into Fox News from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. during the President‚Äôs remarks. https://t.co/4t5icr0cBn https://t.co/t9mZYobQGt
@deedles813 @realDonaldTrump He called it the "Kung Fu," he's put immigrant children in cages, his Muslim travel ban, and yes, because he calls it the "Chinese virus." If he wasn't trying to pin it on China, why use the name of the country? Plus, all the other stuff that you're ignoring that I'm not typing.
@MikeGarcia2020 Happy Fathers day Mike. My father taught me : if you lie you cheat, if you cheat , you steal, if you steal you lie, if you lie you cheat......its all connected forever. Break the cycle tell the truth about trump for your children‚Äôs sake or continue to deny trump lies.
This is completely untrue. 

President Trump himself votes by mail, our military members vote by mail, and every American should be able to vote by mail during a pandemic. 

Voting by mail is safe, reliable, and secure.

According to audio obtained, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told VP Pence on call w/ govs today that Pres. Trump's rally comments about testing were "not helpful" and asked for a "commitment that there's not a federal mandate to slow down testing."
@realDonaldTrump They are going to the registered voter. Oregon votes by mail. No issues, it‚Äôs awesome.

Trump is lying about mail in voting. It‚Äôs awesome.
To all of you @realDonaldTrump enablers at @WhiteHouse and @GOP who said Trump was ‚Äújoking‚Äù about slowing down testing, he made you look like liars and fools again. He‚Äôs not joking. He‚Äôs pathetic, stupid and dangerous.

Honestly, it's the President. All the usual suspects tried to water it down as much as possible and Trump refused to back down. Even when they said it would effect his hotels, he stuck to his guns.

According to audio obtained, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told VP Pence on call w/ govs today that Pres. Trump's rally comments about testing were "not helpful" and asked for a "commitment that there's not a federal mandate to slow down testing."

@weijia: "Why does he use racist phrases like 'the Kung Flu'?"

@PressSec: "He doesn't."
Outrageous that Sanders supporters are still reluctant to vote for Biden. I mean, the guy's tried everything, from not moving an inch leftward on policy to positioning himself on the right of Trump on Venezuela. What do these people want?? https://t.co/mIVbumQZUJ

Democrats want to burn it down. President Trump wants to build it up. This is so simple to see. And yet?
People keep asking me who deserves credit for this tremendous win... 

Honestly, it's the President. All the usual suspects tried to water it down as much as possible and Trump refused to back down. Even when they said it would effect his hotels, he stuck to his guns.
Some states are seeing record daily increases of cases, but the Trump administration has yet to come up with a plan to deal with this public health and economic crisis. 

We need more tests, more PPE, and real economic relief‚Äîand we need it now.

Watching the White House press briefing, I don't know how many questions we've already had about Trump's use of the phrase "Kung Flu." What's the media arguing here? That Trump is an anti-Chinese racist? Or that he is ready to sell out the country to China? Hard to figure.
Here‚Äôs why this matters:

Stone told Trump and his campaign in advance about WikiLeaks‚Äô planned release of Clinton emails Russia stole.

Trump publicly welcomed and made full use of that help. 

Later, it appears Trump lied about it to Mueller.

No wonder they kept this hidden.
The thing w Trump's slow down the testing line is that it's not clear that's happening now. Testing continues to grow. But there's quite a lot of evidence he DID do this in February and March, the critical span in which the fates of tens of thousands of Americans were sealed.
I agree Sen. Coons

The most important news from the weekend was *confirmation* of suspicion that Roger Stone was the link between Trump himself and Russian saboteurs. Yet the press corps gave wall-to-wall coverage to Trump's failed rally in OK. It can make different choices, and should.

It should win the Pulitzer. The image so perfectly encapsulates a man realizing, after decades of bending reality to his will, that reality wins out.
In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.

You must also actively oppose Trump, call rioters peaceful protesters, attack Trump voters, and support tearing down Grant and Teddy Roosevelt statues.

Those are the actual rules.
@JoeBiden @SharylAttkisson numbers. The character of the nation? I hope so. You and your traitorous boss used your 8 years to damage the character of the nation so badly that only a strong patriot like Trump can undo the damage you did.

President Trump himself votes by mail, our military members vote by mail, and every American should be able to vote by mail during a pandemic. 

Voting by mail is safe, reliable, and secure. https://t.co/aY2M87EtTQ
So, to summarize: Mail-in voting is bad because it hurts Republicans by increasing turnout and Democrats use it to commit virtually nonexistent voter fraud...but it‚Äôs fine if Trump and his lackeys do it.

Trump has repeatedly jeopardized the health of Americans and has refused responsibility. During his dangerous rally this weekend, he continued to lie about protecting people with preexisting conditions despite actively working to repeal the ACA and its protections.
There are two tweets from Donald Trump today that give false information about mail-in voting and intend to mislead voters.  YOU MUST REPORT THEM.  It is imperative that @twitter and @jack receive an overwhelming number of reports.

Top Republicans who voted by mail or requested absentee ballots:

So tell me #BlackLivesMatter and #Democrats,  if you have the right to protest, doesn't #MAGA2020 have a right to assemble? You blocked the entrance into the Trump rally on Saturday.

Trump addressed female aides as ‚Äúhoney,‚Äù ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúdarling.‚Äù If he didn‚Äôt like how they looked, he would say, ‚ÄúHoney, you look so tired.‚Äù Trump about his female advisers: ‚ÄúThey look OK in person, but on TV they look really bad. Why do they look so bad?‚Äù

@SykesCharlie NOTE - A door count placed the Trump rally officially placed crowd at 6,116. Of those, 2,837 were paid gig actors &amp; 986 were Trump Campaign 2020, 532 were WH/Trump propaganda machine employees, 183 were plainclothes security meaning: 1,578 WERE TOTAL REAL ATTENDEES!
So trump supporters were afraid to go to the Boc center in Tulsa because they were afraid of the radical left demonstrators. Talk about a bunch of snowflakes ! They love to play the victim even as they stand around with ak47s across their bodies! Assholes!
Love how mocking trump for appearing to have a disability is a neutral/positive act that cannot influence others, but saying "I am very unenthusiastic about voting for someone who explicitly considers being like me an insult" makes you personally responsible if they lose.

Voting by mail works. Trump voted by mail. Our service members &amp; their families overseas vote by mail. Many states vote by mail or use mail in absentee ballots routinely. Let's be clear, this is Trump trying to delegitimize the outcome of an election he's going to lose.
In other words, yes.

As Trump continues to tweet lies about "rigged" elections due to mail-in ballots, it is important to remember that Trump himself voted by mail.

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.

@Chopz87 @TexanRussell @parscale @realDonaldTrump From certain areas, yes. I went to a Trump rally last year. The entire area around the arena was shut down for several blocks. Everybody filed in through one line that stretched about ten city blocks. Along the line were lots of vendors trying to sell hats and stuff, and other...
Just give a sharpie to Donald Trump and he'll fix the low rally attendance...

@DrEricDing We are stupid.  Blue states do not have to follow trump and red states.  That is our only hope without any national mitigation plan.  We don't have to reinvent the wheel.  Other countries have hammered the virus so can we.  We can't rely on the MORON in the white house. https://t.co/itDI9RpzEU

Trump is still running concentration camps.
Trump is still hiding his taxes.
Russia is still attacking the U.S. with Trump's help.
Trump still uses a KKK campaign slogan.
The GOP is willfully complicit.

@Standtogether71 @ace_maddie @drj38571 @theangiestanton Also don't forget that Trump forces Government staff to stay at his Hotels and our taxes then go straight to Trump to pay for their stay. Freedom of Information act has also shown that Trump charges Secret Service and other administration staff more than other customers to stay.
Who are these people and why are they in charge?

McEnany says Trump sought to name Jay Clayton, head of SEC who has not been a prosecutor, to head the US attorney‚Äôs office at SDNY ‚Äúbecause Mr. Clayton wanted to go back to New York City, we wanted to keep him in government, and therefore he was given the position at SDNY.‚Äù
John Bolton on ABC: "The only person in the White House that I'm aware of that didn't focus on the national security implications for Ukraine was Donald Trump."
This actually says quite a bit about what Trump and the Republican Party have done to America.

https://t.co/rohYqDdclh
John Bolton's chief grievance is that the Trump White House was not structured in such a way that enabled Bolton to pursue his lifelong goal of projecting a psychotically hawkish version of US power all over the world. And of course liberals are eating it right up

As Trump continues to tweet lies about "rigged" elections due to mail-in ballots, it is important to remember that Trump himself voted by mail.

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.

Trump has repeatedly jeopardized the health of Americans and has refused responsibility. During his dangerous rally this weekend, he continued to lie about protecting people with preexisting conditions despite actively working to repeal the ACA and its protections.
The Trump rally set records with viewers online and on TV - and not one word from Fake News. 

Lots of people wouldn‚Äôt bring their children or the elderly to the rally because of fear of attack by violent leftist anarchists.

If you can bear to actually listen to Trump‚Äôs Tulsa speech, you‚Äôll hear him talk endlessly (for a dozen long minutes) about why he drank water so slowly at his recent appearance (expensive red tie) and why he crept down the ramp (leather-bottomed shoes). Nothing of importance.

Trump should never have tried to hold a rally in Tulsa on 6/19 during a pandemic. The entire affair was a fiasco - from being forced to change the date to the bragging beforehand about crowd attendance. It seems a just outcome that only 6,200 turned up!

When Trump fired inspectors general, Senate Republicans backed him.

Trump fired the US Attorney investigating his allies, and Senate Republicans are backing him.

Corruption is their brand.
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.

Bolton is a rock-ribbed conservative. There‚Äôs not a RINO bone in his body. He was Trump‚Äôs national security adviser for 17 months. He saw Trump every day, up close, as president. He won‚Äôt vote for him again. He thinks a second Trump term would be too dangerous for the country.
So Bolton has the audacity to sit up here and admit that he literally witnessed Trump conspiring with China to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election ... but he never told Congress nor did he alert anyone that the President was committing  treason-AGAIN. https://t.co/tz4tpXEsZD

Obviously, the media‚Äôs pearl-clutching re: Trump‚Äôs use of the satirical (not ‚ÄúRACIST!‚Äù) term ‚ÄúKung Flu‚Äù is to suppress the fact that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in - and was purposefully allowed to spread from - China.

‚ÄúMark‚Äôs deal with Trump is highly utilitarian, It‚Äôs basically about getting free rein and protection from regulation. Trump needs Facebook‚Äôs thumb on the scale to win this election.‚Äù Twitter isn‚Äôt perfect by any stretch but at least Jack cares a little. Zuckerberg is ammoral. 2/2

Literally nothing else that matters between now and November 3rd.

We can't stand by and let that happen.
I'll say it again: Trump is against universal vote-by-mail because he thinks that he‚Äôll win re-election if fewer people turn out to vote.

It‚Äôs past time to expand voting access for all. We have to keep fighting for it.

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
So Trump, Ivanka, Jared, Kayleigh, Kellyanne, Pence, and Ronna McDaniel all voted by mail
Barr is setting up the scene to use the levers of justice (and taxpayer dollars) to help Trump contest the vote in November. He needs to be impeached.
As Trump continues to tweet lies about "rigged" elections due to mail-in ballots, it is important to remember that Trump himself voted by mail.

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.

As Trump continues to tweet lies about "rigged" elections due to mail-in ballots, it is important to remember that Trump himself voted by mail.

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.
Quite clever but totally lacking in intelligence.
If you are buying the line that Trump ordering aides to slow down testing was just a joke, you have to ignore the fact that the Trump administration is currently withholding $14 billion from testing.
@mon_coeur_gay Well, you have a point. He is a patho liar. His brother Fred jr. died of alcoholic choices.  He was the hier until daddy tossed him aside and annointed the donald.

Others say Trump does not drink. Not one person has ever reported him boozing.  I think he does not.
BREAKING: Sen. Schumer and Murray: The Trump admin has been sitting on nearly $14 billion in funding that Congress passed for coronavirus testing and contact tracing.
@blitznstitch @ZachandMattShow @votepact 46.9% did not vote in 2016 - Had anyone of these decided at the last minute to "vote for someone else" ie Johnson or Stein, their vote would not have been considered "a vote for Trump", but a vote against Trump.

@GReschenthaler If you agree with Bolton that a US President should be tough on foreign adversaries, then you definitely should vote Trump. 

The other is just too weak.
If you think Trump is on the ropes and will surely lose in November, think again. He will do anything to be reelected. Our side has limits because we believe in democracy. Trump has no limits because he doesn't.
For a breakdown of exactly why today's claims are wrong, you can read this piece. The TLDR version is ballots are different in every single county across the U.S., and scanners literally won't read the ballot even from a previous election in that county

@SG_McTaggart @mrjamesob There is no bottom, as you said: Trump's strategy is obviously, "I know they don't like me, but if I sling enough disinformation and hatred at the opponent, highlighting their bad actions as well, I can suppress the other side's voters." It isn't working on Biden like others tho.

You were booked to speak to the overflow crowd at Trump's rally. But there were so few attendees that the outside stage was dismantled while Trump was still speaking and you were left to speak to an empty car park.

IMO, the Trump Administration needs to dedicate an INSANE amount of resources to finding out where mail in ballots are being sent, and ensuring our election is secure. 

Literally nothing else that matters between now and November 3rd.

If you think Trump is on the ropes and will surely lose in November, think again. He will do anything to be reelected. Our side has limits because we believe in democracy. Trump has no limits because he doesn't.

@realDonaldTrump People have been voting by mail since the civil war!  Trump, Melania and Ivanka all vote by mail.  The only reason Trump wants people not to vote by mail is because he knows that the more people who vote the slimmer his odds of winning become.
They know Biden is unelectable. Whatever cards they're holding, they‚Äôre going to play their hand long before he gets to lose.

I‚Äôd be shocked if they even allow him to debate Trump.

Trump‚Äôs narcissism is pathological. The pandemic had curtailed his freedom to conduct his ‚Äúbig rallies‚Äù &amp; he resented that. He was bored &amp; needed a ‚Äúnarcissism fix‚Äù from a rally. That the attendance was so low (6,200 of 19,000) was surely a huge blow, mentally.

People who falsely think Pelosi fights Trump would be informed by a debate.

We look forward to hearing from @CNN &amp; @sfchronicle about when they‚Äôd like to host one.

Every time I think of Trump &amp; his 19,000 MAGAts packed together in an auditorium, I think of the gymnasium scene at the end of ‚ÄúCarrie.‚Äù 

Am I a bad person?
Asked why Trump uses racist terms like ‚ÄúKung Flu,‚Äù McEnany says ‚Äúthe president doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù (Trump did use that term at the rally).
To be fair , we had a better light show!
After Trump met with Putin in Helsinki, a group of senior officials asked Trump to tell them about the conversation. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt want to share,‚Äù the former White House official said. ‚ÄúHis mind-set was: This is between me and my friend.‚Äù

https://t.co/lyYRerHfoX
Internet audience was also HUGE!!!
Bolton alleges in his book that Trump went to a meeting with the British Prime Minister Theresa May and was apparently UNAWARE THE UK HAD BEEN A NUCLEAR POWER FOR 70 YEARS.
1. He encouraged Russia to interfere.

2. He hugged Putin and stiff-armed our intelligence folks.

3. He pressured Ukraine to interfere.

4. He begged China to interfere.

5. And now he‚Äôs spreading his own disinformation to interfere with our election.

Donald Trump is a traitor.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.

We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.
Breaking news Donald Trump used the word ‚Äú Kung flu‚Äù fake media fixing to have a stroke over this . They didn‚Äôt give a dam about cities being destroyed and looted , just Kung Flu .
Trump knows he can‚Äôt win legitimately if voters vote, so he‚Äôs redoubling his lie that mail-in balloting is rife with fraud. Don‚Äôt take 11/3 for granted: He &amp; his enablers will do everything to suppress the vote &amp; manipulate results. That was true before Tulsa, more true now.
This is an incredibly misleading headline.

COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2-14 days.

Attributing a spike to Trump‚Äôs rally that happened less than 48 hours ago is misleading.

Let‚Äôs call this what it is - FAKE NEWS!

https://t.co/SiJGZEYlyU
Voting by mail works. Trump voted by mail. Our service members &amp; their families overseas vote by mail. Many states vote by mail or use mail in absentee ballots routinely. Let's be clear, this is Trump trying to delegitimize the outcome of an election he's going to lose.

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.

I challenge to prove that the test kit of coronavirus is big fraud.I request Maharashtra govt to apply this test kit on fruit,Vegetables,birds, animals anything. You will find lab results will come positive.Actually the virus is being spread by the test kit.
Mail-in ballots have a much longer and less controllable chain of custody than in-person ballots. That means a greater likelihood of fraud. 

Democrats seem awfully close-minded about the potential for voter fraud given that they spent years insisting that Russia elected trump.

I watched, it was humiliating. 
Proving once again how out of touch @realDonaldTrump is to boast about this nightmareüòÇ
Every single time I point out that Trump‚Äôs supporters aren‚Äôt fighting for him to win, I get asked (with absurdly whiny tweets) ‚Äúwhat can we do?!?!???!‚Äù

Ok. Here‚Äôs a list of things you can do to fight back.

1) wear your MAGA hat unapologetically 
2) put a Trump sign on your lawn
@RealBrysonGray Love. This is what we all need to do! Be brave &amp; show our support it will help others be brave too. I guess it depends on your area too, I live near myrtle beach &amp; lots of people wear Trump hats etc.
Asked why Trump uses racist terms like ‚ÄúKung Flu,‚Äù McEnany says ‚Äúthe president doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù (Trump did use that term at the rally).
Total now up to 11.2M having watched @realDonaldTrump online...and this isn‚Äôt even counting folks who watched on TV or in-person! Big record!
So, to summarize: Mail-in voting is bad because it hurts Republicans by increasing turnout and Democrats use it to commit virtually nonexistent voter fraud...but it‚Äôs fine if Trump and his lackeys do it.
Shorter:
"Sir, do you want to double down on being an idiot and an embarrassment?"

"Absolutely."
Thinking about the complete meltdown Trump is having right now is giving me all the feels üíôüíô
To all of you @realDonaldTrump enablers at @WhiteHouse and @GOP who said Trump was ‚Äújoking‚Äù about slowing down testing, he made you look like liars and fools again. He‚Äôs not joking. He‚Äôs pathetic, stupid and dangerous.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.

I'll say it again: Trump is against universal vote-by-mail because he thinks that he‚Äôll win re-election if fewer people turn out to vote.

It‚Äôs past time to expand voting access for all. We have to keep fighting for it.
In other words, yes. https://t.co/cQuMFBw3tQ

Since Trump is trying to gaslight Americans into believing mail-in Ballots are fraudulent, here are the facts:

- The U.S. has allowed mail-in ballots since the Civil War (157+ years ago)

- Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Brad Parscale all vote by mail.
I'm not mocking disability, because I wouldn't. I drop glasses myself.

I'm mocking the fact that Trump and his supporters actually DO seem to believe this idea of superiority, that war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. 

10/10
8. What this means is that mail/in voting represents a serious threat to Trump because it significantly undermines a way that he can benefit from Russia‚Äôs interference: Mail ballots can‚Äôt be hacked; they leave a paper trail; and they can be easily counted in a recount
BREAKING: Trump just confirmed he slowed coronavirus testing because it looked bad for him. Americans got sick and died because of this fraud and negligence. Trump belongs in prison for the rest of his life. Not joking.
Trump has repeatedly jeopardized the health of Americans and has refused responsibility. During his dangerous rally this weekend, he continued to lie about protecting people with preexisting conditions despite actively working to repeal the ACA and its protections.

So reassuring to see how many former Trumpsters just aren‚Äôt into him any longer. The bloom is off the deadly rose. It‚Äôs fast becoming a putrid stench.
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
@RubenGallego Maybe that's the case in Phoenix. Talk to the incompetent mayor not Trump.

Trump fired the US Attorney investigating his allies, and Senate Republicans are backing him.

It gets lost in the word salad, but Trump's misunderstanding here is something lots of people get confused about wrt metrics and decision-making.

We don't *have* cases because we test. We *know about* cases because we test. *Knowing* about cases lets us limit *additional* cases.
Trump has repeatedly jeopardized the health of Americans and has refused responsibility. During his dangerous rally this weekend, he continued to lie about protecting people with preexisting conditions despite actively working to repeal the ACA and its protections.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.

BREAKING: Trump just confirmed he slowed coronavirus testing because it looked bad for him. Americans got sick and died because of this fraud and negligence. Trump belongs in prison for the rest of his life. Not joking.
@ChloeSalsameda @OANN It's a joke right, Bidens campaign only want 3 debates. If the Trump election wants more the Biden camp will renige.If they were that positive of a win(polling)they could garantee victory  with more. With 3 they can limit the scope and details of selective topics. Farce!

If you want to re-open schools in the fall, you need three things.

3. A rotation system (FEWER PEOPLE AT ONCE). 

If we don‚Äôt make these changes, school will be canceled and that will be awful.

Manipulated polls meant to 'legitimize' rigged election results?

@JoeBiden Yes. The nation needs to be forever changed. Trump is the only way to achieve that. You and your cronies will destroy the very fabric of this nation, you‚Äôve already tried. You will not succeed.
@Ordinary1World If I ask them why they support Trump and they use the same cookie cutter response that *every* Trump supporter has used since 2016 - yes. Fuck those people. They need to read a book.

In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.

Last year on Holocaust Remembrance Day, Pres. Trump said ‚Äúin the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power...to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good.‚Äù

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.
@sarahsway55 @therecount Except, they do. 4 million teenagers turn 18 before November. Many of them will vote. 

And if teenagers can successfully troll an entire campaign and put Trump into a funk, maybe Trump and his campaign should consider another strategy.

We need answers for why Berman, Trump‚Äôs own nominee, was fired just 5 months before the election. I am not aware of that ever happening before.

Witnesses can testify broadly about any disagreements or political influence without jeopardizing confidentiality of investigations.
We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
Trump knows voting by mail is safe. He‚Äôs spreading lies to lay the groundwork for challenging the results of this election.

Like any addict after a weekend binge, Trump is now visited by the four horsemen: misery, despair, embarrasement and mail-in ballots. @realDonaldTrump
I'll say it again: Trump is against universal vote-by-mail because he thinks that he‚Äôll win re-election if fewer people turn out to vote.

It‚Äôs past time to expand voting access for all. We have to keep fighting for it.
(It also clearly makes no sense because a contagious virus spreading in the US is different than a war being fought overseas, but even aside from that...)
@CNBC Kudrow also said that Trump's control of coronavirus was "pretty close to air tight."

The economy is Trump's only chance at re-election. That is why Trump did nothing in Feb/Mar and slowed testing. An outbreak would look bad. Trump gambled it would go away. He is gambling now. https://t.co/xIgEwoSbMP

@Mieshagirl1 @MORDE110 @SenSchumer Read the damned Mueller Report. It is full of collusion. Unfortunately, collusion is not a crime. Conspiracy is, but Mueller felt he didn't have enough evidence to prove conspiracy. And that was because several of Trump's crew destroyed evidence. Read it.

Important to be neither complacent nor over dramatic about this. When case numbers low, small changes will do this to R number - we may see similar here in future. However, it is still a sharp reminder that virus hasn‚Äôt gone away and could quickly take off again. Care needed.

1. He encouraged Russia to interfere.

2. He hugged Putin and stiff-armed our intelligence folks.

3. He pressured Ukraine to interfere.

4. He begged China to interfere.

5. And now he‚Äôs spreading his own disinformation to interfere with our election.

Donald Trump is a traitor.

When are they going to stop making excuses for what Trump says, it makes them look so stupid because Trump can't stop saying shit he shouldn't on live TV, he can't help it, he is incapable of being a decent human being with normal emotions towards others, he can't feel empathy.

I'll say it again: Trump is against universal vote-by-mail because he thinks that he‚Äôll win re-election if fewer people turn out to vote.

It‚Äôs past time to expand voting access for all. We have to keep fighting for it.

Tulsa's not that big, not centrally located, his approval has dropped, and even many Trump supporters are genuinely worried about COVID--going to a supposedly packed arena, mocked for wearing a mask--they passed.

@maddow Can you imagine if @realDonaldTrump would have tackled the Coronavirus head on with the full force of the U.S. government resources? Trump could have been the hero instead of the villain. But he just doesn‚Äôt have that in him.
Just a suggestion

Forget the "Free Tickets" to attend a Trump Rally

Charge $10 per ticket and make it also a "Fund Raiser".........Small Individual Donations are all LEGAL

This will stop all the BS - Antifa, BLM, Democrats, Bots, Trolls.

None will Spend $10

@parscale
Health experts say without a vaccine, the only way to safely reopen is to do millions of tests each day.

We're nowhere close, but because numbers are making him look bad, @realDonaldTrump is slowing down testing.

This is unacceptable. He is endangering lives to spare his ego.
corona virus is a heteronormative scam ....

John Bolton is an angry, disgruntled traitor who is trying to get back at President Trump because he was fired. I don‚Äôt plan on contributing a cent to him by buying his book.  Are you going to read it ???
Calm down, I am sure there are perfectly good reasons President Trump's spokeswoman lied about why he nominated pro-Wall Street SEC chairman with no prosecutorial experience to be the US's lead prosecutor in New York, where Trump's businesses and lawyers are situated
.@FrankFigliuzzi1: "Prosecutors aren't supposed to be Trump's people. They're supposed to be America's people, but this move looks like POTUS is trying to move one of his people into one of most important prosecutor position in country. It makes this smell very badly." #AMRstaff

@RyanAFournier Correction Trump is the worst period
donald trump YOU ADMITTED ON JUNE 20TH AT YOUR RALLY IN TULSA OK THAT YOU DELIBERATELY TOLD YOUR ADMINISTRATION TO SLOW THE COVID-19 TESTING DOWN!
YOU THEREFORE ADMITTED THAT YOU ARE THE  "MASS MURDERER OF JUNE 22ND OF  120,106 COVID-19 DEATHS! trump YOU FAILED THE AMERI PPL!
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
Pence was in quarantine for being exposed and then disappeared for awhile. Trump was exposed but did not quarantine.I am trying to figure out how trump has avoided COVID. His staff has had it. In Dallas, he shook hands, no mask. Any ideas?
In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.

@ClayTravis I was hospitalized in January with pneumonia, respiratory failure and sepsis. At the time they said I had an unidentified virus, COVID wasn't a thing yet. I've thought ever since that I might have had it then.
McEnany says Trump sought to name Jay Clayton, head of SEC who has not been a prosecutor, to head the US attorney‚Äôs office at SDNY ‚Äúbecause Mr. Clayton wanted to go back to New York City, we wanted to keep him in government, and therefore he was given the position at SDNY.‚Äù

Trump's laying the groundwork for an election challenge. Barr's corrupt enough to help him do it. That's why the House must impeach Barr. Even if the Senate won't convict it puts down a historical marker that this is not OK and creates a factual record exposing Barr's corruption. https://t.co/tj5bU7gyrr

In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.

You're going to see a lot of charts like these. We saw a lot of charts like these in 2016.

IGNORE THEM.

They want you to assume he's lost and stay home.

DON'T.

They want a low enough turnout they can manipulate the results.

VOTE IN NUMBERS SO LARGE THEY CAN'T CHEAT.
We thought the COVID-19 scandal was Trump learning of the virus in January and doing nothing effective or relevant to curtail it until March. Wait until America learns the White House had all the details on the virus in November and failed to prevent the *December* outbreak here.
Remember, they worked hand in hand in 2016, too. The Seth Rich conspiracy, pizzagate, and more. It's all part of the same media ecosystem, some BS created by Russia, some by Trump et al., all promoting each other. #synergy https://t.co/iclODcFx3O
Why do all these White House reporters have sticks up their asses

Nobody except Washington DC actually gives a shit that Trump said "kung flu"

We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.
Life is back to normal. Many Kenyans don't believe corona virus is real. No wearing of masks, no social distancing. People are back to having public gatherings. Football fans go to video halls to watch games and the agreement is that they keep quiet even when a goal is scored.
There is every chance Donald Trump will lose in November, declare the election illegitimate and refuse to stand down, triggering the greatest US constitutional crisis since the civil war.
People keep asking me who deserves credit for this tremendous win... 

Honestly, it's the President. All the usual suspects tried to water it down as much as possible and Trump refused to back down. Even when they said it would effect his hotels, he stuck to his guns.

We thought the COVID-19 scandal was Trump learning of the virus in January and doing nothing effective or relevant to curtail it until March. Wait until America learns the White House had all the details on the virus in November and failed to prevent the *December* outbreak here.
@RepFrenchHill Some people may want to leave but there is nowhere to go. Trump has us baned or treated poorly most everywhere. Thanks for helping him the State and the American public will remember it for sure.
All the HATE in America is coming from the Left, not the right.

Twice today Trump was asked the question: Did you order testing to be slowed? 
Twice he didn't answer, and neither time did he say -- as aides insist -- that he was joking.
People are killing, getting killed, destroying property, and burning buildings 

MSM is super stressed about President Trump saying Kung flu 

Lighten up. The shits funny.

We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.
Trump's entire presidency can be considered criminal negligence.
Trump reportedly has 14 loans on 12 properties. At least 6 of those loans represent nearly half a billion dollars in debt and are due over the next four years. If Trump has a financial problem, that could affect how lobbyists curry favor with him.

So when Trump‚Äôs next rally is completely packed, with massive overflow, what will the media narrative be then?
do western artists even get questioned about their views on tr*mp
This bizarre talking point the Trump Administration is selling that there are more coronavirus cases because they‚Äôre doing such a great job is one of the most shameless and dangerous pieces of authoritarian double-speak we‚Äôve ever seen.
BREAKING: Trump just confirmed he slowed coronavirus testing because it looked bad for him. Americans got sick and died because of this fraud and negligence. Trump belongs in prison for the rest of his life. Not joking.
1. He encouraged Russia to interfere.

2. He hugged Putin and stiff-armed our intelligence folks.

3. He pressured Ukraine to interfere.

4. He begged China to interfere.

5. And now he‚Äôs spreading his own disinformation to interfere with our election.

Donald Trump is a traitor.
Thank you!

RIP to another Trump conspiracy theory!
I'll say it again: Trump is against universal vote-by-mail because he thinks that he‚Äôll win re-election if fewer people turn out to vote.

It‚Äôs past time to expand voting access for all. We have to keep fighting for it.
Just months before an election in which millions of Americans will be voting by mail, combined with the GOP's $20M voter intimidation scheme, tRUmp must think he has the perfect recipe for the #GOP to lock in another ten years of #rigged maps for their #RIGGEDELECTION üá∫üá∏üí™üåä

Trump is a racist piece of shit.

Joe Biden is going to serve his corporate donors and do meek reform they allow while not being the total racist piece of shit Trump is.

Apparently those are our choices and Democrats are proud of their offering.
Can this picture of Joe Biden get more retweets than the number of people at Trump's rally?

It is very, very, very alarming Trump doesn't understand the tests are not causing the disease, they are just tracking the disease that already exists. This is very, very, very simple reasoning.

Republicans are fucking stupid.

Mail-in ballots have a much longer and less controllable chain of custody than in-person ballots. That means a greater likelihood of fraud. 

Democrats seem awfully close-minded about the potential for voter fraud given that they spent years insisting that Russia elected trump.

@stephenblong Trump isn‚Äôt a political leader. He isn‚Äôt a faction or an ideology. He‚Äôs a religion.

@JamesJDavids @DanFurgzilla @SportsCenter No, you do think like this. Trump thinks like this, and people like you support him, which means you support racism and injustice.
At the end of the day, Bolton's main criticism of @realDonaldTrump can be boiled down to:

"He didn't listen to my advice &amp; refused to carpet bomb half the world to start World War 3."

If Trump had taken Bolton's war mongering advice, do you really think he would be doing this?

We thought the COVID-19 scandal was Trump learning of the virus in January and doing nothing effective or relevant to curtail it until March. Wait until America learns the White House had all the details on the virus in November and failed to prevent the *December* outbreak here.
In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.
Voting by mail works. Trump voted by mail. Our service members &amp; their families overseas vote by mail. Many states vote by mail or use mail in absentee ballots routinely. Let's be clear, this is Trump trying to delegitimize the outcome of an election he's going to lose.
@TONYxTWO @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump @HeyTammyBruce @SteveHiltonx @FoxNews Yup nothing to say about facts so you pivot to something else...trump grabs folks by the P and just kisses them... To small minded to stay on topic feckless simpleton...

@jonoringer You hypocrite. Shutterstock reduces royalties during corona pandemic and you dare speaking of building and helping entrepreneurs? What about the contributors who helped build Shutterstock and are now left to rot? You allowed this to happen.

- Do agree with the president in slowing down nationwide COVID-19 testing?

- Are you ok with the president's decision to suddenly fire Berman?

2. He hugged Putin and stiff-armed our intelligence folks.

3. He pressured Ukraine to interfere.

4. He begged China to interfere.

5. And now he‚Äôs spreading his own disinformation to interfere with our election.

Donald Trump is a traitor.

WARNING: Trump is telling us that he‚Äôll refuse to accept a loss this November as legitimate. We need to believe him and prepare to fight back if we‚Äôre to preserve our democracy.
We need answers for why Berman, Trump‚Äôs own nominee, was fired just 5 months before the election. I am not aware of that ever happening before.

We can't stand by and let that happen.

BREAKING: VP Mike Pence and his wife both voted by mail in the Indiana GOP primary in April.

On a morning where Trump railed against mail-in voting, we now know that Pence, Ronna McDaniel Romney, Kayleigh McEnany, and Trump himself ALL voted by mail.

So Trump, Ivanka, Jared, Kayleigh, Kellyanne, Pence, and Ronna McDaniel all voted by mail

No shit dumbass. Fuck his supporters.
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
Florida has mail in and has for years trump voted illegally in 2018 by mail
.@PressSec says President Trump using the term kung-flu is a "indictment" on China and not about blaming Asian Americans for the virus.

Note: Many Americans, including Asian Americans who have faced increased attacks during the pandemic, find the term racist and offensive.
Don‚Äôt get cocky, people. Bill is spot on.
@DC_Draino Not just Cuomo, but every person who refused to use HCQ for family members because Trump suggested it. There will be a lot of people feeling guilty as hell when they realized their family members didn‚Äôt have to die. Hate can keep someone from thinking rationally. God can forgive

President Trump and Kayleigh McEnany both committed absentee voter fraud, too.

@MadDDawgY @spartandog97 Democrats did that, not trump supporters. Democrats were famous for lynchings. This whole thing is backed and funded by democrats to scare black men back to the plantation and it‚Äôs not working. They mind killing a few innocent black men for their message to get across
Trump had a bad night in Tulsa. Very low turnout. Even his supporters know that COVID-19 is real and dangerous, and should not be spread at an indoor rally. More importantly, maybe people are catching on that he is a pathological liar and a fraud. Let's keep fighting.

When Trump said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in the face+nothing would happen, we dismissed it as bloviating.  He has, thru incompetence+ greed, killed 9 migrant children and 127,000 Americans. The GOP did NOTHING to STOP HIM. VOTERS WILL!
(1/2) Bill Kristol nailed it - Trump will use EXECUTIVE POWER to shape events this Fall. NADLER MUST FOCUS ON BARR. It DOESN'T MATTER whether the Senate convicts. It matters that the public narrative around Barr is clear and widespread. Trump is WAY less formidable without Barr.
Trump was outsmarted by teenagers. He should be grateful they saved thousands of people from getting infected by the virus.

To everyone asking me for stats&amp; evidence,thats not my job!Its the government's job to reassure us and I dont feel reassured.Also if you are a racist,trump supporter,pro brexit,Borris army troll I'm not going to even waste my time replying to you.
If Trump had donned a mask early in the pandemic, ordered his White House staff to do the same, pressured GOPers and his supporters at every level to do the same, that alone would have saved thousands of lives.
Apparently POTUS doesn‚Äôt have any advisers worth their keep. The tech issues should have been on top of their Risk Management List!!üò°üò°üò°
@realDonaldTrump Trump knows that the only way he'll win in November is"SUPPRESS THE VOTE".He wants few polling stations,especially in minority voting areas,to steal the election!Trump'll mail in his own voting ballot but he wants Americans to risk their lives to vote in person!
@RonaldKlain 2 things Trump seems to think he's accomplished 
...Health(tearing the shit out of the ACA &amp; Medicare)
...Economy( was on a 10 year incline from the Recovery Act Obama/Biden) that Trump inherited...then destroyed.*Biden helped lay the foundation down &amp; will be one to rebuild it!
let‚Äôs not forget that elijah daniel was literally banned from trump rallies, arrested by secret service and put on a no fly list for trying to throw a glittery dildo at trump and now they got him on bbc to speak about a trump rally
@morethanmySLE Trump's answer proves the obvious 

Black lives matter to Trump only as a way to falsely brag about himself 

Black lives have no independent value to Trump.   The only value is as his prop &amp; tag line to use and abuse. 

Trump is a cruel, evil and dangerous human
It will spread like a virus.
Trump expected tens and tens of thousands of people to show up for him in Tulsa.

Only 6,200 did.

I think there may be a sea change taking place around the country and people are catching on to the fraud that Donald Trump is. https://t.co/Ew2rv1hLUF
So Trump, Ivanka, Jared, Kayleigh, Kellyanne, Pence, and Ronna McDaniel all voted by mail
@Tom_Winter @PeteWilliamsNBC @jonathan4ny @ckubeNBC Trump's gone out of his way to undermine efforts to rid the military of white nationalists and extremist groups. He's equated goddamned Nazis with those who protest against them.

Trump remains the biggest threat to the nation in every way imaginable.
RT if you watched the Trump rally from home on Saturday.

The media is mocking Trump because the stadium in Tulsa wasn't full.

RT if you were one of the millions of people watching!
Voting by mail works. Trump voted by mail. Our service members &amp; their families overseas vote by mail. Many states vote by mail or use mail in absentee ballots routinely. Let's be clear, this is Trump trying to delegitimize the outcome of an election he's going to lose.

.@PressSec says President Trump was speaking in jest when he said at his Saturday rally that he had asked that coronavirus testing be slowed.

But below, he was asked directly whether he was joking and didn't answer directly.
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.

Trump had a bad night in Tulsa. Very low turnout. Even his supporters know that COVID-19 is real and dangerous, and should not be spread at an indoor rally. More importantly, maybe people are catching on that he is a pathological liar and a fraud. Let's keep fighting.
If you mean "Alter the Character" by Standing for our Flag, Standing with our Police, Kneeling only for our Creator "God",valuing our history not tearing it down, having peaceful protests that doesn't consist of burning the city to the ground, then I say YES! 4 more yrs please!üá∫üá∏
Sad sack
@Sse_beingBlack @dbongino Every claim made against Trump has been proven to be untrue. None of the Dem‚Äôs plans to get rid of Trump will work. The dem‚Äôs desperation to stop trump from revealing their crimes against the US is clear. The impeachment trials were just the beginning of their desperation
To be fair , we had a better light show!
Eight years in jail will be insufficient for @realDonaldTrump 

If he slowed covid19 testing with purely political intent as clearly stated in last weekend's Tulsa speech that makes him America's biggest peacetime mass murderer.

‚ÄúTrump rally gives Fox News largest Saturday night audience in its history‚Äù https://t.co/XZaStbbRIp
Ok let me break this down for you. 

The k-pop kids didn't cause the rally to be poorly attended. Having an indoor rally in the middle of a pandemic did that. 

What the kids did do, was absolutely wreck the Trump campaigns voter tracking and id system.  Let me explain 

X/1
@morconis @ACLU @carolynmichelle Cult?  Is that it. Also that's rich coming from a trump supporter
Who are these people and why are they in charge?
@JoeBiden Here is the Democratic candidate attacking Trump *from the right* again

1, Maduro is Venezuela's elected president, not a "dictator"

2, Trump has been obsessively backing coup attempts against Maduro, while killing Venezuelans with a suffocating blockade

Ever wonder why none of the celebs who vowed to move to Canada if Trump won still here almost 4 yrs later?üôÑ
There is a serious effort to intimidate prominent Trump supporters by any means available: advertisers, customers, social media etc. Don't worry, we are in this fight to save America for the long haul. There's no quit in us.
Folks, if you were thinking of buying John Bolton's book, or even downloading it for free from somewhere to avoid the war-monger getting a penny, I advise you to read Seth Abramson's thread instead. More insightful in fewer words
That, along with 270 electoral votes, would win re-election.

This tweet will get more likes than Donald Trump had people at his rally.
Trump is furious that his crowd was tiny in Tulsa. But I'm furious, too, that he used his platform to make racist "Kung Flu" jokes after 120,000 Americans have died on his watch and because of his negligence. This monster needs to go.
BREAKING: Trump just confirmed he slowed coronavirus testing because it looked bad for him. Americans got sick and died because of this fraud and negligence. Trump belongs in prison for the rest of his life. Not joking.
We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.
@Alexarenee1 Just make sure you‚Äôre reporting TRUMP‚ÄôS tweet &amp; not mine. Lol
So, to summarize: Mail-in voting is bad because it hurts Republicans by increasing turnout and Democrats use it to commit virtually nonexistent voter fraud...but it‚Äôs fine if Trump and his lackeys do it.
Unless Trump pushes the pace and forces Biden to literally collapse on a media set, there's no path to a win for Trump.
At end of briefing, McEnany read out viewership total for Trump‚Äôs rally on Fox, suggesting a larger audience for Tulsa. Reminiscent of when Spicer said Trump had largest inaugural crowd size because of people watching both in person and around the world.
@BigRedTS @SarahMargulis2 @beinlibertarian @Jorgensen4POTUS There is essentially no difference between Trump or Biden winning. Americans lose either way.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.

WARNING: Trump is telling us that he‚Äôll refuse to accept a loss this November as legitimate. We need to believe him and prepare to fight back if we‚Äôre to preserve our democracy.
A poll of just Duval County/Jacksonville (where the RNC may happen) has Biden leading 51-43. https://t.co/NWdcfHE1qs

County of about 1 million went Trump +1 in 2016, then Gillum +4 in 2018.
We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
8. What this means is that mail/in voting represents a serious threat to Trump because it significantly undermines a way that he can benefit from Russia‚Äôs interference: Mail ballots can‚Äôt be hacked; they leave a paper trail; and they can be easily counted in a recount

As Trump continues to tweet lies about "rigged" elections due to mail-in ballots, it is important to remember that Trump himself voted by mail.

In fact, Trump used a vote-by-mail ballot in Florida's primary election in 2020.

We can't stand by and let that happen.

Ok let me break this down for you. 

The k-pop kids didn't cause the rally to be poorly attended. Having an indoor rally in the middle of a pandemic did that. 

What the kids did do, was absolutely wreck the Trump campaigns voter tracking and id system.  Let me explain 

X/1
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
Fox, Dana and Charlie Kurtz, just jumped on the fact and showed empty seats with no mention of all the disruption outside and NO mention of the huge crowds waiting outside.   We,@POTUS  supporters, notice Fox new biases as well...
do western artists even get questioned about their views on tr*mp

@NorberFerreyros @joborg @ottartwain @MLevitt_NP2013 @FT @FinancialTimes I doubt that any significant transmission of the virus happened parent-to-parent in proximity to schools. For starters, many kids in suburban/urban areas get to school by their own devices. Also, surface/contact spread as well as asymptomatic ditto have been called into question.
If Trump had donned a mask early in the pandemic, ordered his White House staff to do the same, pressured GOPers and his supporters at every level to do the same, that alone would have saved thousands of lives.

In 2016, Pres. Trump claimed voter fraud to explain his loss in the popular vote. It was a lie. Now, with horrible polling, he's trying to delegitimize the vote - through suppression and more lies about voting by mail. This is a big story. Put all his allies on the record.

This is completely untrue. 

President Trump himself votes by mail, our military members vote by mail, and every American should be able to vote by mail during a pandemic. 

Voting by mail is safe, reliable, and secure.
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
BREAKING: Trump just confirmed he slowed coronavirus testing because it looked bad for him. Americans got sick and died because of this fraud and negligence. Trump belongs in prison for the rest of his life. Not joking.

2. He hugged Putin and stiff-armed our intelligence folks.

4. He begged China to interfere.

5. And now he‚Äôs spreading his own disinformation to interfere with our election.

Donald Trump is a traitor.
So Trump, Ivanka, Jared, Kayleigh, Kellyanne, Pence, and Ronna McDaniel all voted by mail
Kudlow went on TV today and said "no second wave coming"

then there's Hassett, on his way out: https://t.co/AuubWc1tS6
So, to summarize: Mail-in voting is bad because it hurts Republicans by increasing turnout and Democrats use it to commit virtually nonexistent voter fraud...but it‚Äôs fine if Trump and his lackeys do it.
Italy was a hot spot for the #coronavirus when Trump said it was a hoax. Now Italy had 264 new #Covid19 cases on the same day that the U.S reported 32,000. The virus is spiking where Republican governors follow Trump instead of public health experts.  https://t.co/JiIZ77zZW3

-He‚Äôs always the dumbest guy in the room
-He‚Äôs the one people have lost confidence in
Trump has repeatedly jeopardized the health of Americans and has refused responsibility. During his dangerous rally this weekend, he continued to lie about protecting people with preexisting conditions despite actively working to repeal the ACA and its protections.

But he has done a TON of things to hurt people.  Do I think Dreamers deserve the treatment...
ABC News: "You also use the phrase in the book that Trump's pattern looks like 'obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn't accept.' Obstruction of justice as a way of life?"

John Bolton: "Look, these were things that I could see some evidence of."
We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

Shortest Trump tell-all book ever, by Noel Casler:
Trump is a drug addict who snorts Adderral. He is incontinent from this drug use. He hates and abuses women. He is a mob money launderer. His adult kids are in on it. The End. @realDonaldTrump
@LizSpecht There is a large looming story, here;  countries which have not handled the virus well, will increasingly be trade-isolated.  Conferences won't be here; Americans won't be welcome w/o quarantines; students and tourists may 'stay away in droves'. And, exports may be limited ...
FAKE NEWS made up for you and your ego
Trump remains his enemies' greatest booster - Bolton's viewership for his ABC special last night w Raddatz was roughly 6 million, or, put another way, about double what Trump got for a special with ABC last year.

This is completely untrue. 

President Trump himself votes by mail, our military members vote by mail, and every American should be able to vote by mail during a pandemic. 

Voting by mail is safe, reliable, and secure.

Either Trump told his staff to slow down testing or he thinks it‚Äôs funny to joke about not testing people during a pandemic that has killed 120,000 people. Trump disciples don‚Äôt seem to understand that either is horrifying.
Like Trump, Barr has himself voted absentee. State voting records show that Barr, a resident of Fairfax County, Va., in the suburbs of Washington, voted by mail in 2019 and 2012.
.@PressSec says President Trump using the term kung-flu is a "indictment" on China and not about blaming Asian Americans for the virus.

Note: Many Americans, including Asian Americans who have faced increased attacks during the pandemic, find the term racist and offensive.
So, to summarize: Mail-in voting is bad because it hurts Republicans by increasing turnout and Democrats use it to commit virtually nonexistent voter fraud...but it‚Äôs fine if Trump and his lackeys do it.
Voting by mail works. Trump voted by mail. Our service members &amp; their families overseas vote by mail. Many states vote by mail or use mail in absentee ballots routinely. Let's be clear, this is Trump trying to delegitimize the outcome of an election he's going to lose. https://t.co/wU1UTUtYq3

Trump is banned from running a charity due to rampant fraud, yet still runs our country! Trump is a malignant narcissist, a disorder responsible for THE most catastrophic behavior in history, yet nobody talks about it! What the $%#@*&amp; are we waiting for, a film? OK, then!  #UNFIT
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èRaise your hand if you think that the SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES was when 51 corrupt Republican Senators voted to keep Trump in office despite a mountain of evidence that he abused his power and obstructed Congress.
I'm starting to think that Barr and Trump messed with the wrong prosecutors. SDNY Strauss is already putting the pedal to the metal and hiding the cases from Barr's reach.
Biden just tweeted that Trump is not tough enough on Venezuela &amp; that he will stand up against Maduro the "thug." Thousands of Black people and working class people are dying as a result of U.S. sanctions - that is not tough enough? But for Biden - "Black lives matter"!!
BLM do not care about Black Lives.  They are Marxists.   They only care about removing Trump from office so they can turn our Country into a 3rd world $hithole. https://t.co/hYk0hE0LdP
Remember, the two main GOP defenses during impeachment were (1) no proof Trump himself delayed aid &amp; (2) it was just a difference over policy. 

Bolton says it was: Trump‚Äôs decision, politically motivated, &amp; part of a pattern. 

Of course his testimony would have mattered.
.@PressSec says President Trump using the term kung-flu is a "indictment" on China and not about blaming Asian Americans for the virus.

Note: Many Americans, including Asian Americans who have faced increased attacks during the pandemic, find the term racist and offensive.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF PETE this Clayton guy Trump/Barr tried to jam into SDNY as U.S. Attorney worked for a company tied to the Russian Mafiya, Iran, Uzbek Gulnara Karimova...

This is completely untrue. 

President Trump himself votes by mail, our military members vote by mail, and every American should be able to vote by mail during a pandemic. 

Voting by mail is safe, reliable, and secure.

You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
Trump supporters see the rally as half full.

@LisaMoraitis1 Agree.

However...I think the main reason all the Republicans except Romney haven't spoken out against trump is because either 1) Putin has damning emails against them all or 2) they all took Russian money for their campaigns several yrs ago, just like the NRA.

Or both. *shrugs*
And this is what @DaveChappelle criticized because he's just another celebrity pandering to the blue pilled and to make money off of racism while pretending to be "not like the other celebrities" when it's just reverse psychology to make money...
Because Trump, Pence, and our federal government under Trump are incapable and incompetent. 

Sad, but true...

@thehill Have the backbone to call it what it is. It was fucking insane for Trump to say that. 120,000 dead. He either admitted to the grossest failure of leadership in recent history. Or he made a joke of it, which is just as telling what kind of man he is.

Trump has repeatedly jeopardized the health of Americans and has refused responsibility. During his dangerous rally this weekend, he continued to lie about protecting people with preexisting conditions despite actively working to repeal the ACA and its protections.

Trump's laying the groundwork for an election challenge. Barr's corrupt enough to help him do it. That's why the House must impeach Barr. Even if the Senate won't convict it puts down a historical marker that this is not OK and creates a factual record exposing Barr's corruption.
@TomFitton That's why the fake news media is concentrating on 'cases' rather than deaths. The virus has weakened, most people don't even know they had it and less people are dying from it.

A day trader "He has no plan, not for the day, the week or the month. No broad strategy. He just acts or, more often, reacts." CNN: John Bolton just revealed Donald Trump's dirty little secret.

Nearly 3 months after we passed legislation to provide stimulus checks for working families, too many still haven't gotten the help they need. I'm leading 78 colleagues in calling on the Trump Administration to answer for this unacceptable delay. https://t.co/NfyxR2hyL1

RT if you agree: the greatest risk to Trump is voter fraud.
@ClueHeywood @scullyseviltwin Remember when your cousin gave us that sanitizer to kill the Ebola virus? üòÇ
If you are buying the line that Trump ordering aides to slow down testing was just a joke, you have to ignore the fact that the Trump administration is currently withholding $14 billion from testing.
.@FrankFigliuzzi1: "Prosecutors aren't supposed to be Trump's people. They're supposed to be America's people, but this move looks like POTUS is trying to move one of his people into one of most important prosecutor position in country. It makes this smell very badly." #AMRstaff

A megachurch is hosting Trump's rally on Tuesday in Phoenix. These two con-men falsely claim they've installed a system which kills 99.9% of COVID-19. 

Arizona's Coronavirus numbers are surging. Madness...https://t.co/6mgM8BLhO9
President Trump and Kayleigh McEnany both committed absentee voter fraud, too.

She used her parents' Tampa home, which was not her residence.

Trump used Mar-a-Lago, which per an 1993 agreement with Palm Beach allowing him to turn it into a club, he can't use as his residence.
I wonder what the ‚ÄúPresident* of Law &amp; Order‚Äù is doing about THIS? üëá

Can‚Äôt have things like globe-topping death &amp; infections stand in the way of Trump‚Äôs most repeated false claim ...‚ÄùThe greatest economy in the history of our country‚Äù!!

4/ In-person voting as default, limiting mail-in discriminates against ALL voters. I fear Trump Tactic is started: ID a goat (mail-in), gin up fear (nat‚Äôl security), issue EO (limit mail in). May be overturned, but will suppress vote.  
Appreciate thoughts. Frustrated.

@TimMurtaugh Strange how everyone Trump hires, appoints, etc., are all useless disgruntled employees the second they disagree with Trump.
BREAKING: Trump just confirmed he slowed coronavirus testing because it looked bad for him. Americans got sick and died because of this fraud and negligence. Trump belongs in prison for the rest of his life. Not joking.
Florida is changing its reporting of Intensive Care Unit beds in order to make the Coronavirus spike look less problematic.

This will kill people. What began with Trump and his Sharpie hurricane map is deadly serious. Pretending that problems aren't real means more people dying.
@SageMccallister @oblivionrecurs Trump supporters don't have to hide themselves like in Cali.
trump knows that when all Americans can vote (i.e. vote by mail), he loses. It's that simple. He's scared, and he should be.
@RonCamp24358031 @MidGaGator72 @CaslerNoel @mforbeck @realDonaldTrump I said I knew! I think the time of vitriol and name calling should be over, and TOGETHER, we all should rebuke Putin.Chad here has been most civil, and I really appreciate that. 
Just know that I've hated trump, the man, since the 90's; precisely for his treatment of people.
Dem. 2020 election strategy is to suppress the Republican vote and stop the re-election momentum.

1.  Mute conservative voices.
2. Publish misleading polls.
3. Isolate Trump voters disrupting rallies.
Yea sure it did. A bunch of teens punked your ass. They had to watch.üòÇüòÇ https://t.co/Bps0rSCqFz https://t.co/6SyTMIbVbE
HE SLOWED DOWN THE TESTING. WHAT LEADER DOES THIS DURING A PANDEMIC.
You look at the polls and think "he can't win." But Trump's path to victory doesn't depend on persuading Americans. It depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference, and unabashed use of executive branch power to shape events, and perceptions, this fall.
So Trump, Ivanka, Jared, Kayleigh, Kellyanne, Pence, and Ronna McDaniel all voted by mail
No shit. The guy is looking for excuses and clueless people to believe those excuses.
I knew from the beginning Covid-19 was NOT deadly, it was only an ordinary flu. I knew also Deep State lied about the virus being deadly in order to scare people - because scared people are the easiest for Deep State to control.

Any of you feel the same way?

.@PressSec says President Trump using the term kung-flu is a "indictment" on China and not about blaming Asian Americans for the virus.

Note: Many Americans, including Asian Americans who have faced increased attacks during the pandemic, find the term racist and offensive.
